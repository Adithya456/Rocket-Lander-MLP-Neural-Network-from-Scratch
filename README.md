# Rocket-Lander-MLP-Neural-Network-from-Scratch
This project implements a feedforward neural network (Multilayer Perceptron) in Python for regression. It minimizes RMSE through training and validation over epochs, with trend visualization. Forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates are built entirely from scratch.
